A couple of notes on the flow of information from Stpotify to track and all the changes that ocur: 
1. spotify.js gets the information and puts it into an array;
2. App.js as an empty state and a couple of methods that will be used to take the data in a change it and pass it to other components
    
    About the state on App.js:
    this.state = {
      searchResults: [],
      playListName: "Top List",
      playListTracks: [], 
      popUpShow: false,
    }
    
    About the method that I want to refelct on App, the search(term): 
    //this method will update the searchResults array in the state of the app
    search(term) {
    Spotify.search(term)
      .then(searchResults => this.setState({
        searchResults: searchResults
      }));
    }
    This method will receive a term that will came from the searchBar, where the user will be able to make a query
    that is why I have to pass this method with an event listener to: <SearchBar onSearch={this.search} />
    Now I have the state of my App.js changed
    Now I can pass the information to where I wanted it to go.

    3. Will pass the information to searchResults for this component to render the result
