## A CODECADEMY CAPSTONE PROJECT

In this project, I have built a React web application called Jammming. 
I will create a couple of React components, state, and requests with the Spotify API to build a website that allows users to search the Spotify library, create a custom playlist, then save it to their Spotify account.
